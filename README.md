# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python program provides a simple command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain fixed value. This program allows users to specify the shift value and perform encryption or decryption on their messages.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt messages by shifting the letters in the alphabet.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt messages by reversing the shift.
- **Case Preservation**: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Non-Alphabet Characters**: Preserves non-alphabet characters during encryption and decryption.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program presents a menu to the user, making it easy to choose between encryption, decryption, or quitting.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by executing the `caesar_cipher.py` script.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - Option 1: Encrypt a message
   - Option 2: Decrypt a message
   - Option 3: Quit the program
3. If you choose encryption or decryption, you'll be prompted to enter the message and the shift value (e.g., 3).
4. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

## Example

### Encryption
Choose an option:

Encrypt
Decrypt
Quit
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!


### Decryption
Choose an option:

Encrypt
Decrypt
Quit
Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3): 3
Decrypted message: Hello, World!
